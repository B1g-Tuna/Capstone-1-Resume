    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Data Analyst and Project Manager (2021 - April 2023)</h3>
            <p>Working for <a href="https://rhochrematics.co.za/">Rhochrematics South Africa</a>, a systems automation company, introduced me to big data and how the inside of automated warehouses work. Captaining some projects myself gave me more hands-on experience than just understanding and processing the data for reports.</p>

        <h3>ML Engineer and Data Scientist (April 2023 - Current)</h3>
            <p>From building web applications & dashboards to creating and implementing machine learning models to improve decision making and saving costs at pyrometallurgical operations. The work at <a href="https://www.xramtech.com/">XRAM Engineering</a> has broadened my experience and understanding of statistics and machine learning engineering and my understanding of the time and money these models and applications can save.</p>
